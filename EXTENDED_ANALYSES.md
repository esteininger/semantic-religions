## 1. Conservative Concepts

![Conservative Concepts](assets/analyses/conservative.png)

### Overview
Measures alignment with traditional conservative values: tradition, authority, hierarchy, order, duty, obedience, family values, divine law.

### Results

| Text | Mean Similarity | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Quran** | **0.2332** | Highest conservative alignment |
| **Torah** | **0.2129** | Moderate-high conservative alignment |
| **Bible** | **0.2041** | Moderate conservative alignment |

### Key Findings:
- **Quran ranks highest** in conservative concepts (tradition, authority, hierarchy)
- All three texts show substantial conservative language
- Relatively small variance (0.029) suggests this dimension is present across all traditions
- Higher than liberal overlap scores, suggesting ancient religious texts naturally emphasize tradition/authority

## Methodological Notes

### Approach
- **Semantic chunking**: Variable-size concept-based segments (~125-146 per text)
- **Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **t-SNE**: 2D dimensionality reduction for visualization
- **Cosine similarity**: Measures semantic alignment to concept centroids

### Limitations
1. **Translation effects**: English translations, not original languages
2. **Concept bias**: Modern Western concept definitions
3. **Context loss**: Chunking removes some narrative context
4. **Semantic only**: Doesn't capture historical/theological nuance
5. **Binary simplification**: Many analyses use false dichotomies

### Interpretation
- Results show **linguistic patterns**, not theological truth
- Scores are **relative comparisons**, not absolute measures
- **Multiple valid interpretations** of these patterns exist
- Should inspire further study, not replace scholarly analysis

## Future Directions

### Additional Analyses
- **Character-specific** (Jesus, Moses, Muhammad)
- **Genre-specific** (poetry, law, narrative, prophecy)
- **Temporal evolution** within each text
- **Multi-dimensional** concept spaces (3D+)
- **Inter-text similarity** mapping

### Methodological Improvements
- **Multilingual models** (analyze in original languages)
- **Contextual embeddings** (BERT, GPT for better semantics)
- **Statistical significance testing**
- **Book-by-book granularity**
